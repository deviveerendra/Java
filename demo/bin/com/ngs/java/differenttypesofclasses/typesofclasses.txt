types of classes in java
1.Concrete class
2.Abstract class
3.Final class
4.POJO class
5.Static class
6.Inner class
   a.Nested Inner class
   b.Method Local Inner class
   c.Anonymous inner classes
   d.Static nested classes
1.concrete class:
  Any normal class that does not have any abstract methods is called concrete class. A concrete class can 
  extend its parent class, an abstract class or implement an interface if it implements all their methods.
2.Abstract class:
  The class which have abstract and non abstract methods are called abstract class.if you did not want to 
  implement abstract methods that are in interface then keep that class as abstract.we cannot create the 
  object of abstract class.it can have static methods and constructors
3.Final class:
  The class that is declared with final is said to be final class.we cannot inherit final class
4.POJO class:
  POJO is said to be plain old java object which contains only private variables and getter and setter methods
5.Static class:
  The class which has only static fields is said to be static class.you cannot create object to static class
6.Inner class:
  The class inside the class is called inner class.The purpose of inner class is to group classes that belongs 
  together,which makes the code more readable and maintainable.
  a.Nested Inner class:
  The class inside the class is nested inner class
  b.Method Local Inner class:
  An inner class can be declared within a method of an outer class.
  c. Anonymous inner classes:
  the class which declares without have any name is called Anonymous inner class
  d. Static nested classes:
  Static nested classes are like a static member of the outer class.
